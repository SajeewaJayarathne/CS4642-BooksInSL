Bantam Press,"Tyler Hamilton, Daniel Coyle","The Secret Race is a definitive look at the world of professional cycling—and the doping issue surrounding this sport and its most iconic rider, Lance Armstrong—by former Olympic gold medalist Tyler Hamilton and New York Times bestselling author Daniel Coyle. Over the course of two years, Coyle conducted more than two hundred hours of interviews with Hamilton and spoke candidly with numerous teammates, rivals, and friends. The result is an explosive book that takes us, for the first time, deep inside a shadowy, fascinating, and surreal world of unscrupulous doctors, anything-goes team directors, and athletes so relentlessly driven to succeed that they would do anything—and take any risk, physical, mental, or moral—to gain the edge they need to win. Tyler Hamilton was once one of the world’s best-liked and top-ranked cyclists—a fierce competitor renowned among his peers for his uncanny endurance and epic tolerance for pain. In the 2003 Tour de France, he finished fourth despite breaking his collarbone in the early stages—and grinding eleven of his teeth down to the nerves along the way. He started his career with the U.S. Postal Service team in the 1990s and quickly rose to become Lance Armstrong’s most trusted lieutenant, and a member of his inner circle. For the first three of Armstrong’s record seven Tour de France victories, Hamilton was by Armstrong’s side, clearing his way. But just weeks after Hamilton reached his own personal pinnacle—winning the gold medal at the 2004 Olympics—his career came to a sudden, ignominious end: He was found guilty of doping and exiled from the sport. From the exhilaration of his early, naïve days in the peloton, Hamilton chronicles his ascent to the uppermost reaches of this unforgiving sport. In the mid-1990s, the advent of a powerful new blood-boosting drug called EPO reshaped the world of cycling, and a relentless, win-at-any-cost ethos took root. Its psychological toll would drive many of the sport’s top performers to substance abuse, depression, even suicide. For the first time ever, Hamilton recounts his own battle with clinical depression, speaks frankly about the agonizing choices that go along with the decision to compete at a world-class level, and tells the story of his complicated relationship with Lance Armstrong. A journey into the heart of a never-before-seen world, The Secret Race is a riveting, courageous act of witness from a man who is as determined to reveal the hard truth about his sport as he once was to win the Tour de France.",2012-09-11,593071743,9780593071748," The Secret Race: Inside the Hidden World of the Tour de France: Doping, Cover-Ups, and Winning at All Costs","Rs. 3,500.00",Paperback,352,-

Now, with Alpha Doku, solvers can turn their logic towards letters, satisfying their craving for a brisk, tantalizing mental exercise in a new and captivating way. Alpha Doku provides 100 puzzles in varying degrees of difficulty, in the same straight-forward, engaging structure of The Times Su Doku Books 1-5 series.

A figure of second-to-none Su Doku credibility, Gould sparked the craze when he brought the puzzles over from Japan and began setting them for The Times.

HARPER COLLINS PUBLISHERS,Lawrence E. Joseph,"Is the world really coming to an end in 2012? According to the Bible, I Ching and the Mayans it is. And, wouldnt you know it, there are already several rock bands, including Houstons very own Downfall 2012, getting ready to party. ""Apocalypse 2012"" is cheerful sceptic Laurence E Josephs investigation into the 2012 Doomsday phenomenon. With its mixture of hard science, investigative reportage and cast of colourful characters, ""Apocaplyse 2012"" is Fast Food Nation for the terminally paranoid. Journalist and science writer, Laurence E. Joseph is our incisive and witty guide unravelling the religious, astrological and mystical prophecies behind the potentially earth-shattering events of 2012. And, at the core of this book, is Josephs investigation into the growing number of scientific researchers trying to figure out why conditions around our planet are becoming so bizarre. His adventures include: hooking up with the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement whose cheerful motto Live Long and Die Out is now available as a tattoo: meeting the scientists who are trying to figure out why the present state of the sun is so worrisome - is it just going through a phase or is something major going on? Visiting Yellowstone National Park to see whether the seething supervolcano could soon stop civilisation dead in its tracks: exploring the possibility of a terrorist attack that could plunge the whole Northern Hemisphere into the equivalent of a nuclear winter. So, if 2012 really is going to be a year of unprecedented catastrophe, what can we do to increase our odds of surviving it? Should we head for the Kentucky hills or hightail it to Western Africa, where an Australian Doomesday 2012 enthusiast is already staking his claim, or perhaps wed be better blasting off for solar systems unknown?",19 February 2007,7227388,9780007227389,Apocalypse 2012: An optimist investigates the end of civilization,"Rs. 5,500.00",Paperback,320,23.2 x 15.2 x 2.8 cm

Penguin Books Ltd (UK),RUCHIR SHARMA,"The argument of BREAKOUT NATIONS is that the astonishingly rapid growth over the last decade of the world's celebrated emerging markets is coming to an end. The era of easy money and easy growth is over. China, in particular, will soon slow, but its place will not necessarily be taken by Brazil, Russia or India, all of which Ruchir Sharma shows have weaknesses and difficulties often overlooked in the inflated expectations and emerging markets mania of the past decade.

Harper Collins,Peter Schweizer,"In 2000, Bill and Hillary Clinton owed millions of dollars in legal debt. Since then, they’ve earned over $130 million. Where did the money come from? Most people assume that the Clintons amassed their wealth through lucrative book deals and high-six figure fees for speaking gigs. Now, Peter Schweizer shows who is really behind those enormous payments. In his New York Times bestselling books Extortion and Throw Them All Out, Schweizer detailed patterns of official corruption in Washington that led to congressional resignations and new ethics laws. In Clinton Cash, he follows the Clinton money trail, revealing the connection between their personal fortune, their “close personal friends,” the Clinton Foundation, foreign nations, and some of the highest ranks of government. This books also throws light into the India’s famous Nuclear Proliferation pact with America. Schweizer reveals the Clinton’s troubling dealings in Kazakhstan, Colombia, Haiti, and other places at the “wild west” fringe of the global economy.

Viking,Bimal Jalan,"As India marks the twenty-year milestone of economic liberalization, some concerns about the country's future prospects as an emerging power are beginning to be voiced: often, these stem from the past history of sharp swings in India's fortunes. Bimal Jalan has closely followed the path of India's economic policies across its changing trajectories, from before the time the economy was liberalized to the very present The pieces that appear here were all written during the last twenty years, with the exception of three prescient notes from the mid-1970s highlighting the need for economic reforms to foster growth. The principal thought behind these essays is that, in the past twenty years, India's capacity to grow faster than ever before has increased substantially because of its comparative advantage in relation to other countries. However, Jalan points out that for India to seize the opportunities that lie ahead, it is essential to bring about further reforms in the running of India's politics and administration in order to ensure inclusive and incremental economic growth.",2012,670085871,9780670085873,"Emerging India: Economics, Politics And Reforms","Rs. 1,980.00",Hardcover,336,-

Oxford University Press,Keith Stewart Thomson,"Fossils have been vital to our understanding of the formation of the earth and the origins of life. However, their impact has not been limited to debates about geology and evolution: attempts to explain their existence has shaken religion at its very roots, and they have remained a subject of ceaseless fascination for people of all ages and backgrounds. In this readable and wide-ranging book, Keith Thomson provides a remarkably all-encompassing explanation of fossils as a phenomenon. How did Darwin use fossils to support his theory of evolution? What are ""living fossils""? What fossils will we leave behind for future generations to examine? Beyond the scientific aspects, Thomson highlights the impact of fossils on philosophy and mythology, our concept of time, and today's popular culture. From the black market to the Piltdown Man, and from mythological dragons to living dinosaurs, fossils hold a permanent place in the popular imagination.",Dec 2005,192805045,9780192805041,Fossils A Very Short Introduction,"Rs. 2,240.00",Paperback,147,6.86 x 4.14 x 0.45 inches

Random House,Julian Crandall Hollick,"Ganga has always been more than just an ordinary river. For millions of Indians, she is also a goddess. Yet the river is exploited as much as she is worshipped. Her water is siphoned off for irrigation, toxic chemicals are dumped into her, and dams and barrages have been built on her course causing immense damage. Ganga is in danger of dying - but if the river dies, will the goddess die too? The question took journalist Julian Crandall Hollick on an extraordinary journey starting at Gaumukh and ending at Sagar Island. Travelling mostly on small country boats, he discovered a river that most people simply do not know: a river that never remains the same, which is often abandoned, and at times is no more than a stream. Combining travelogue, science and history, Ganga is a fascinating - and troubling - portrait of the river today. It will show you Ganga as you have never seen her before.",2007,8184000030,9788184000030,Ganga ,"Rs. 1,930.00",Hardcover,292,-

It also touches upon a wealth of topics that students find fascinating black holes, warped spacetime, gravitational waves, and cosmology. Until now, it has not been included in the curriculum of many undergraduate physics courses because the required math is too advanced. The aim of this ground-breaking new text is to bring general relativity into the undergraduate curriculum and make this fundamental theory accessible to virtually all physics majors. Using a ""physics first"" approach to the subject, renowned relativist James Hartle provides a fluent and accessible introduction that uses a minimum of new mathematics and illustrates a wealth of applications. Recognizing that there is not enough time in a short introductory course to present the traditional, tensor theory approach, James Hartle provides in this book a number of pedagogical innovations.",2006,8129700948,9788129700940,Gravity An Introduction to Einstiens General Relativity,"Rs. 2,250.00",Paperback,-,-

Written in the age of the atom when America and Europe optimisitcally viewed the discovery of life on Mars as inevitable, Bradbury's 1940s short stories of a brutal, stark and unforgiving martian landscape were as shocking and visionary as they were insightful. 'The Martian Chronicles' tells the story of humanity's repeated attempts to colonize the red planet. The first men were few. Most succumbed to a disease they called the Great Loneliness when they saw their home planet dwindle to the size of a pin dot. Those few that survived found no welcome. The shape-changing Martians thought they were native lunatics and duly locked them up. More rockets arrived from Earth, piercing the hallucinations projected by the Martians. People brought their old prejudices with them -- and their desires and fantasies, tainted dreams. These were soon inhabited by the strange native beings, with their caged flowers and birds of flame.",1995,6479235,9780006479239,Martian Chronicles (Flamingo Modern Classic),"Rs. 1,800.00",Paperback,240,7.6 x 4.9 x 0.9 inches

The early medieval period takes us to a more complex polity dominated by the rise of powerful Tamil empires under the Pallava and Chola dynasties. The strengthening of the state apparatus was accompanied by the emergence of many administrative and representative institutions. In this larger landscape, merchants were key agents of growth and change. Towering over the region, both literally and figuratively, the temple emerged as the central, definitive institution dominating social and economic life in the region known as Tamilakam.

Public Affairs," Richard Dobbs,James Manyika,Jonathan Woetzel","Our intuition on how the world works could well be wrong. We are surprised when new competitors burst on the scene, or businesses protected by large and deep moats find their defenses easily breached, or vast new markets are conjured from nothing. Trend lines resemble saw-tooth mountain ridges. The world not only feels different. The data tell us it is different. Based on years of research by the directors of the McKinsey Global Institute, No Ordinary Disruption: The Four Forces Breaking all the Trends is a timely and important analysis of how we need to reset our intuition as a result of four forces colliding and transforming the global economy: the rise of emerging markets, the accelerating impact of technology on the natural forces of market competition, an aging world population, and accelerating flows of trade, capital and people. Our intuitions formed during a uniquely benign period for the world economy--often termed the Great Moderation. Asset prices were rising, cost of capital was falling, labour and resources were abundant, and generation after generation was growing up more prosperous than their parents. But the Great Moderation has gone. The cost of capital may rise. The price of everything from grain to steel may become more volatile. The world's labor force could shrink. Individuals, particularly those with low job skills, are at risk of growing up poorer than their parents. What sets No Ordinary Disruption apart is depth of analysis combined with lively writing informed by surprising, memorable insights that enable us to quickly grasp the disruptive forces at work. For evidence of the shift to emerging markets, consider the startling fact that, by 2025, a single regional city in China--Tianjin--will have a GDP equal to that of the Sweden, of that, in the decades ahead, half of the world's economic growth will come from 440 cities including Kumasi in Ghana or Santa Carina in Brazil that most executives today would be hard-pressed to locate on a map. What we are now seeing is no ordinary disruption but the new facts of business life-- facts that require executives and leaders at all levels to reset their operating assumptions and management intuition.",2015-06-10,1610395794,9781610395793,No Ordinary Disruption: The Four Global Forces Breaking All the Trends,"Rs. 3,050.00",Hardcover,288,-

RANDOM HOUSE,Charles Duhigg,"From the author of the ""New York Times ""bestselling phenomenon ""The Power of Habit ""comes a fascinating new book that explores the science of productivity, and why, in today s world, managing ""how"" you think rather than ""what"" you think can transform your life. A young woman drops out of a PhD program and starts playing poker. By training herself to envision contradictory futures, she learns to anticipate her opponents missteps and becomes one of the most successful players in the world. A group of data scientists at Google embark on a four-year study of how the best teams function, and find that ""how"" a group interacts is more important than ""who"" is in the group a principle, it turns out, that also helps explain why ""Saturday Night Live"" became a hit. A Marine Corps general, faced with low morale among recruits, reimagines boot camp and discovers that instilling a bias toward action can turn even the most directionless teenagers into self-motivating achievers. The filmmakers behind Disney s ""Frozen"" are nearly out of time and on the brink of catastrophe until they shake up their team in just the right way, spurring a creative breakthrough that leads to one of the highest-grossing movies of all time. What do these people have in common? They know that productivity relies on making certain choices. The way we frame our daily decisions: the big ambitions we embrace and the easy goals we ignore: the cultures we establish as leaders to drive innovation: the way we interact with data: These are the things that separate the merely busy from the genuinely productive. At the core of ""Smarter Faster Better"" are eight key concepts from motivation and goal setting to focus and decision making that explain why some people and companies get so much done. Drawing on the latest findings in neuroscience, psychology, and behavioral economics as well as the experiences of CEOs, educational reformers, four-star generals, FBI agents, airplane pilots, and Broadway songwriters this painstakingly researched book explains that the most productive people, companies, and organizations don t merely act differently. They view the world, and their choices, in profoundly different ways. In""The Power of Habit, "" Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Charles Duhigg explained why we do what we do. In ""Smarter Faster Better, ""he applies the same relentless curiosity, deep reporting, and rich storytelling to explain how we can improve at the things we do. It s a groundbreaking exploration of the science of productivity, one that can help anyone learn to succeed with less stress and struggle, and to get more done without sacrificing what we care about most to become smarter, faster, and better at everything we do. Advance praise for ""Smarter Faster Better"" As he did in ""The Power of Habit, ""Duhigg melds cutting-edge science, deep reporting, and wide-ranging stories to give us a fuller, more human way of thinking about how productivity actually happens. Susan Cain, author of ""Quiet"" Duhigg uses engaging storytelling to highlight fascinating research and core principles that we can all learn and use in our daily lives. A masterful must-read for anyone who wants to get more (and more creative) stuff done. David Allen, author of ""Getting Things Done"" Duhigg has a gift for asking just the right question, and then igniting the same curiosity in the rest of us. In ""Smarter Faster Better"" he finds provocative answers to a riddle of our age.

Cambridge University,(Edited) Rita Barnard,"Nelson Mandela was one of the most revered figures of our time. He committed himself to a compelling political cause, suffered a long prison sentence and led his violent and divided country to a peaceful democratic transition. His legacy however is not uncontested: his decision to embark on an armed struggle in the 1960s, his solitary talks with apartheid officials in the 1980s and the economic policies adopted during his presidency still spark intense debate, even after his death. The essays in this Companion, written by experts in history, anthropology, jurisprudence, cinema, literature and visual studies, address these and other issues. They examine how Mandela became an icon during his lifetime and consider the meanings and uses of his internationally recognizable image. Their overarching concerns include Mandela's relation to 'tradition' and 'modernity', the impact of his most famous public performances, the oscillation between Africanist and non - racial positions in South Africa and the politics of gender and national sentiment. The volume concludes with a meditation on Mandela's legacy in the twenty-first century and a detailed guide to further reading.",2014-04-13,1107440009,9781107440005,The Cambridge Companion to Nelson Mandela,"Rs. 1,600.00",Paperback,349,-

The early medieval period takes us to a more complex polity dominated by the rise of powerful Tamil empires under the Pallava and Chola dynasties. The strengthening of the state apparatus was accompanied by the emergence of many administrative and representative institutions. In this larger landscape, merchants were key agents of growth and change. Towering over the region, both literally and figuratively, the temple emerged as the central, definitive institution dominating social and economic life in the region known as Tamilakam.

Harper Collins,Alistair Maclean,"From the acclaimed master of action and suspense. The all time classic Millions of pounds in gold bullion are being pirated in the Irish Sea. Investigations by the British Secret Service, and a sixth sense, have bought Philip Calvert to a bleak, lonely bay in the Western Highlands. But the sleepy atmosphere of Torbay is deceptive. The place is the focal point of many mysterious disappearances. Even the unimaginative Highland Police Sergeant seems to be acting a part. But why? This story is Alistair MacLean at his enthralling best. It has all the edge-of-the-seat suspense, and dry humour that millions of readers have devoured for years.",2008,7252943,9780007252947,When Eight Bells Toll,"Rs. 1,475.00",Paperback,384,-

Scribner Book Company,David Quammen,"A two-time winner of the ""National Magazine"" Award takes readers from the central Amazon to the streets of New York to explore scientific facts, ideas, and wonders. In ""Wild Thoughts from Wild Places,"" award-winning journalist David Quammen reminds us why he has become one of our most beloved science and nature writers. This collection of twenty-three of Quammen's most intriguing, most exciting, most memorable pieces takes us to meet kayakers on the Futaleufu River of southern Chile, where Quammen describes how it feels to travel in fast company and flail for survival in the river's maw. We are introduced to the commerce in pearls (and black-market parrots) in the Aru Islands of eastern Indonesia. Quammen even finds wildness in smog-choked Los Angeles -- embodied in an elusive population of urban coyotes, too stubborn and too clever to surrender to the sprawl of civilization. With humor and intelligence, David Quammen's ""Wild Thoughts from Wild Places"" also reminds us that humans are just one of the many species on earth with motivations, goals, quirks, and eccentricities.

Harper Collins India,Janhavi Acharekar,"These charming portraits of young girls living far from home, 'secure' in their illicit relationships, of young men full of RSS swagger, of old women waiting late in the night for their grown-up children to come home, capture the lives of ordinary people in vivid and varied hues. Spread across the socio-economic spectrum, these stories are like snapshots of interesting faces in a crowd: faces around whom the author deftly sketches lives and longings, pet ideas and prejudices, loves and hates with bold, confident strokes. From 'Ganesha', the story of a middle-class housewife waiting for her son to return at night and thinking of her other son who died in a road accident, to 'A Game of Cards' about a young urban woman sunning herself on the beach, these pithy sketches are a colourful montage of modern Indian life.",2009,8172238002,9788172238001,Window Seat,"Rs. 1,475.00",Paperback,256,-
