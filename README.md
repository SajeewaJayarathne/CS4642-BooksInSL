  <b>Corpus</b>
  <br>
  <span>The corpus used is about the information of English, Sinhala, and Tamil books that are available for selling in 
  Sri Lanka. Most important information of books that a buyer would seek, such as The book title, the author, and the price 
  is displayed in every book with the picture of the book cover. Some contain the summary, and other information like 
  publisher, published date, binding method, and number of pages. Moreover, the ISBNs are also displayed, so that not only 
  a buyer, but also publishers, authors, and book sellers are able to gain specific knowledge from that. Further, 
  English books are categorized as general books, discounted books, rare books, and second-hand books, while the book of 
  other two languages have only the general category.</span>
