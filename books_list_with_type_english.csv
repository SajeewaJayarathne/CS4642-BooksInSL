 PLUTO PRESS," Jonathan Spence, Jonathan Goodhand, Shahul Hasbulla","Is religion best seen as only a cause of war, or is it a source of comfort for those caught up in conflict? Checkpoint, Temple, Church and Mosque is based on fieldwork in Sri Lanka's most religiously diverse and politically troubled region in the closing years of the civil war. It provides a series of new and provocative arguments about the promise of a religiously based civil society, and the strengths and weaknesses of religious organisations and religious leaders in conflict mediation. It argues that for people trapped in long and violent conflicts, religion plays a contradictory role, often acting as a comforting and stabilising force but also, in certain situations, acting as a source of new conflict. Additionally, war itself can lead to profound changes in religious institutions: Catholic priests engage with Buddhist monks and new Muslim leaders, while Hindu temples and Pentecostal churches offer the promise of healing. This book will provoke new debate about the role of religious organisations and leaders in situations of extreme conflict and will be of great interest to students of anthropology, development studies, religious studies and peace/conflict studies.",2014-12-20,0745331211,9780745331218,DISCOUNTED BOOKS,"Checkpoint, Temple, Church and Mosque: A Collaborative Ethnography of War and Peace","Rs. 4,950.00",Paperback,224,-

Arrow,Reza Aslan,"*Why do they hate us? An entire cottage industry has arisen to answer this question. But what no one has really figured out is, who exactly are they? Is it al-Qaeda? Islamic nationalists? The whole Muslim world?*HOW TO WIN A COSMIC WAR lays out, for the first time, a comprehensive definition of the movement behind and surrounding al-Qaeda and the like, a global ideology properly termed Jihadism. *Contrasting twenty-first-century religious extremism across Christianity, Judaism and Islam with its historical antecedents, Aslan demonstrates that while modern Jihadis may have legitimate social grievances - the suffering of the Palestinians, American support for Arab dictators, the presence of foreign troops in Muslim lands, to name a few - they have no real goals or actual agenda.*So, what do the Jihadists want? Aslan's answer is: Nothing. The Jihadists have no earthly agenda: they are fighting a metaphysical conflict, a theological war. And ever since 9/11, we have unfortunately been fighting the same cosmic war, the war they want: the so-called 'War on Terror'.*How do we win a Cosmic War? By refusing to fight in one. And in this stunning new work, Aslan reveals surprising conclusions about how we can deal with this predicament.",2010-04-06,009953889X,978-0099538899,SECOND-HAND BOOKS,How to Win a Cosmic War,Rs. 450.00,paperback,240,-

In the second part he engages in a critical study of colonialism, the devaluing of primordial institutions and the imposing of different social structures, leaving individuals to fight their way through a society to which they were tenuously connected.

Random House,Julia Angwin,"A few years ago, MySpace.com was just an idea kicking around a Southern California spam mill. Scroll down to the present day and MySpace is one of the most visited Internet destinations in America, displaying more than 40 billion webpage views per month and generating nearly $1 billion annually for Rupert Murdoch’s online empire. Even by the standards of the Internet age, the MySpace saga is an astounding growth story, which climaxed with the site’s acquisition by Murdoch’s News Corporation in 2005 for a sum approaching one billion dollars. But more than that, it may be the defining drama of the digital era. In Stealing MySpace, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Julia Angwin chronicles the rise of this Internet powerhouse. With an unerring eye, Angwin details how MySpace took the Internet by storm by grabbing the best ideas from around the Web, encouraging pinup stars such as Tila Tequila to make their home on its pages and giving everyone freedom to experiment with online identities–including using somebody else’s identity. Stealing MySpace introduces us to the site’s founders, Chris DeWolfe and Tom Anderson, who dabbled in computer hacking, online pornography, spam, and spyware before starting MySpace. Although their street savvy, doggedness, and clubbing skills far eclipsed their tech prowess, they stumbled their way to success and soon found themselves at ground zero of a high-stakes war that pitted Rupert Murdoch against his frequent nemesis, the combative Viacom CEO Sumner Redstone. Angwin sheds light on the dizzying backroom deals that allowed Murdoch to snatch MySpace from Viacom’s grasp even as the MySpace founders remained in the dark about their own fate. Then she takes us inside the Murdoch empire as DeWolfe and Anderson lobby furiously to regain control of their creation. Venturing beyond the business aspects of the story, Angwin also explores the Internet culture, a voyeuristic world in which MySpace must stay one step ahead of amateur pornographers, sexual predators, and “spoofers” who set up fake profiles (Rupert Murdoch himself tolerates dozens of phony “Ruperts” on the site) and cope with the general excesses and sometimes illegal acts of a community of account holders equal in number to the population of Japan. In Stealing MySpace, Julia Angwin dishes on the epic real-world battle for control of a virtual empire. In a savvy, smart, fast-paced narrative reminiscent of Bryan Burrough and John Helyar’s Barbarians at the Gate and Michael Lewis’s The New New Thing, Stealing MySpace tells is the whole gripping story behind a breakout cultural phenomenon.",2009-03-17,1400066948,9781400066940,SECOND-HAND BOOKS,Stealing MySpace: The Battle to Control the Most Popular Website in America,"Rs. 1,100.00",Hardcover,-,-

HARPER COLLINS PUBLISHERS,Lawrence E. Joseph,"Is the world really coming to an end in 2012? According to the Bible, I Ching and the Mayans it is. And, wouldnt you know it, there are already several rock bands, including Houstons very own Downfall 2012, getting ready to party. ""Apocalypse 2012"" is cheerful sceptic Laurence E Josephs investigation into the 2012 Doomsday phenomenon. With its mixture of hard science, investigative reportage and cast of colourful characters, ""Apocaplyse 2012"" is Fast Food Nation for the terminally paranoid. Journalist and science writer, Laurence E. Joseph is our incisive and witty guide unravelling the religious, astrological and mystical prophecies behind the potentially earth-shattering events of 2012. And, at the core of this book, is Josephs investigation into the growing number of scientific researchers trying to figure out why conditions around our planet are becoming so bizarre. His adventures include: hooking up with the Voluntary Human Extinction Movement whose cheerful motto Live Long and Die Out is now available as a tattoo: meeting the scientists who are trying to figure out why the present state of the sun is so worrisome - is it just going through a phase or is something major going on? Visiting Yellowstone National Park to see whether the seething supervolcano could soon stop civilisation dead in its tracks: exploring the possibility of a terrorist attack that could plunge the whole Northern Hemisphere into the equivalent of a nuclear winter. So, if 2012 really is going to be a year of unprecedented catastrophe, what can we do to increase our odds of surviving it? Should we head for the Kentucky hills or hightail it to Western Africa, where an Australian Doomesday 2012 enthusiast is already staking his claim, or perhaps wed be better blasting off for solar systems unknown?",19 February 2007, 0007227388,9780007227389,BOOKS,Apocalypse 2012: An optimist investigates the end of civilization,"Rs. 5,500.00",Paperback,320,23.2 x 15.2 x 2.8 cm

Harper Paperbacks,Jim Marrs,"The Rise of the Fourth ReichThrow out everything you think you know about history. Close the approved textbooks, turn off the corporate mass media, and whatever you do, don't believe anything you hear from the government. The Rise of the Fourth Reich reveals the truth about American power. In this explosive exposÃ‰, the legendary Jim Marrs explores the frighteningly real possibility that today, in the United States, an insidious ideology thought to have been vanquished more than a half century ago is actually flourishing. At the end of World War II, ranking Nazis, along with their young and fanatical protÃ‰gÃ‰s, used the loot of Europe to create corporate front companies in many countries, worming their way into corporate America. They brought with them miraculous weapons technology that helped win the space race. But they also brought their Nazi philosophy based on the authoritarian premise that the end justifies the meansâ€”including unprovoked wars of aggression and curtailment of individual libertiesâ€”which has since gained an iron hold in the ""land of the free."" Jim Marrs has gathered compelling evidence of the effort that has been under way for the past sixty years to bring a form of National Socialism to modern America, creating in essence a new empire-or ""Fourth Reich""!",-,61245593,9780061245596,DISCOUNTED BOOKS,The Rise of the Fourth Reich,"Rs. 1,800.00",-,448,5.3 x 7.9 x 1.1 inches

 Simon & Schuster,Eben Alexander,"A SCIENTIST'S CASE FOR THE AFTERLIFEscientific community have argued that they are impossible. Dr. Eben Alexander was one of those people.A highly trained neurosurgeon who had operated on thousands of brains in the course of his career, Alexander knew that what people of faith call the “soul” is really a product of brain chemistry. NDEs, he would have been the first to explain, might feel real to the people having them, but in truth they are simply fantasies produced by brains under extreme stress.Then came the day when Dr. Alexander’s own brain was attacked by an extremely rare illness. The part of the brain that controls thought and emotion—and in essence makes us human— shut down completely. For seven days Alexander lay in a hospital bed in a deep coma. Then, as his doctors weighed the possibility of stopping treatment, Alexander’s eyes popped open. He had come back.Alexander’s recovery is by all accounts a medical miracle. But the real miracle of his story lies elsewhere. While his body lay in coma, Alexander journeyed beyond this world and encountered an angelic being who guided him into the deepest realms of super-physical existence. There he met, and spoke with, the Divine source of the universe itself.This story sounds like the wild and wonderful imaginings of a skilled fantasy writer. But it is not fantasy. Before Alexander underwent his journey, he could not reconcile his knowledge of neuroscience with any belief in heaven, God, or the soul. That difficulty with belief created an empty space that no professional triumph could erase. Today he is a doctor who believes that true health can be achieved only when we realize that God and the soul are real and that death is not the end of personal existence but only a transition.This story would be remarkable no matter who it happened to. That it happened to Dr. Alexander makes it revolutionary. No scientist or person of faith will be able to ignore it.

Viking,Bimal Jalan,"As India marks the twenty-year milestone of economic liberalization, some concerns about the country's future prospects as an emerging power are beginning to be voiced: often, these stem from the past history of sharp swings in India's fortunes. Bimal Jalan has closely followed the path of India's economic policies across its changing trajectories, from before the time the economy was liberalized to the very present The pieces that appear here were all written during the last twenty years, with the exception of three prescient notes from the mid-1970s highlighting the need for economic reforms to foster growth. The principal thought behind these essays is that, in the past twenty years, India's capacity to grow faster than ever before has increased substantially because of its comparative advantage in relation to other countries. However, Jalan points out that for India to seize the opportunities that lie ahead, it is essential to bring about further reforms in the running of India's politics and administration in order to ensure inclusive and incremental economic growth.",2012,0670085871,9780670085873,BOOKS,"Emerging India: Economics, Politics And Reforms","Rs. 1,980.00",Hardcover,336,-

Random House,Julian Crandall Hollick,"Ganga has always been more than just an ordinary river. For millions of Indians, she is also a goddess. Yet the river is exploited as much as she is worshipped. Her water is siphoned off for irrigation, toxic chemicals are dumped into her, and dams and barrages have been built on her course causing immense damage. Ganga is in danger of dying - but if the river dies, will the goddess die too? The question took journalist Julian Crandall Hollick on an extraordinary journey starting at Gaumukh and ending at Sagar Island. Travelling mostly on small country boats, he discovered a river that most people simply do not know: a river that never remains the same, which is often abandoned, and at times is no more than a stream. Combining travelogue, science and history, Ganga is a fascinating - and troubling - portrait of the river today.

In this readable and wide-ranging book, Keith Thomson provides a remarkably all-encompassing explanation of fossils as a phenomenon. How did Darwin use fossils to support his theory of evolution? What are ""living fossils""? What fossils will we leave behind for future generations to examine?

The early medieval period takes us to a more complex polity dominated by the rise of powerful Tamil empires under the Pallava and Chola dynasties. The strengthening of the state apparatus was accompanied by the emergence of many administrative and representative institutions. In this larger landscape, merchants were key agents of growth and change.

Most succumbed to a disease they called the Great Loneliness when they saw their home planet dwindle to the size of a pin dot. Those few that survived found no welcome. The shape-changing Martians thought they were native lunatics and duly locked them up. More rockets arrived from Earth, piercing the hallucinations projected by the Martians. People brought their old prejudices with them -- and their desires and fantasies, tainted dreams.

Public Affairs," Richard Dobbs,James Manyika,Jonathan Woetzel","Our intuition on how the world works could well be wrong. We are surprised when new competitors burst on the scene, or businesses protected by large and deep moats find their defenses easily breached, or vast new markets are conjured from nothing. Trend lines resemble saw-tooth mountain ridges. The world not only feels different. The data tell us it is different. Based on years of research by the directors of the McKinsey Global Institute, No Ordinary Disruption: The Four Forces Breaking all the Trends is a timely and important analysis of how we need to reset our intuition as a result of four forces colliding and transforming the global economy: the rise of emerging markets, the accelerating impact of technology on the natural forces of market competition, an aging world population, and accelerating flows of trade, capital and people. Our intuitions formed during a uniquely benign period for the world economy--often termed the Great Moderation. Asset prices were rising, cost of capital was falling, labour and resources were abundant, and generation after generation was growing up more prosperous than their parents. But the Great Moderation has gone. The cost of capital may rise. The price of everything from grain to steel may become more volatile. The world's labor force could shrink. Individuals, particularly those with low job skills, are at risk of growing up poorer than their parents. What sets No Ordinary Disruption apart is depth of analysis combined with lively writing informed by surprising, memorable insights that enable us to quickly grasp the disruptive forces at work. For evidence of the shift to emerging markets, consider the startling fact that, by 2025, a single regional city in China--Tianjin--will have a GDP equal to that of the Sweden, of that, in the decades ahead, half of the world's economic growth will come from 440 cities including Kumasi in Ghana or Santa Carina in Brazil that most executives today would be hard-pressed to locate on a map. What we are now seeing is no ordinary disruption but the new facts of business life-- facts that require executives and leaders at all levels to reset their operating assumptions and management intuition.",2015-06-10,1610395794,9781610395793,BOOKS,No Ordinary Disruption: The Four Global Forces Breaking All the Trends,"Rs. 3,050.00",Hardcover,288,-

RANDOM HOUSE,Charles Duhigg,"From the author of the ""New York Times ""bestselling phenomenon ""The Power of Habit ""comes a fascinating new book that explores the science of productivity, and why, in today s world, managing ""how"" you think rather than ""what"" you think can transform your life. A young woman drops out of a PhD program and starts playing poker. By training herself to envision contradictory futures, she learns to anticipate her opponents missteps and becomes one of the most successful players in the world. A group of data scientists at Google embark on a four-year study of how the best teams function, and find that ""how"" a group interacts is more important than ""who"" is in the group a principle, it turns out, that also helps explain why ""Saturday Night Live"" became a hit. A Marine Corps general, faced with low morale among recruits, reimagines boot camp and discovers that instilling a bias toward action can turn even the most directionless teenagers into self-motivating achievers. The filmmakers behind Disney s ""Frozen"" are nearly out of time and on the brink of catastrophe until they shake up their team in just the right way, spurring a creative breakthrough that leads to one of the highest-grossing movies of all time. What do these people have in common? They know that productivity relies on making certain choices. The way we frame our daily decisions: the big ambitions we embrace and the easy goals we ignore: the cultures we establish as leaders to drive innovation: the way we interact with data: These are the things that separate the merely busy from the genuinely productive. At the core of ""Smarter Faster Better"" are eight key concepts from motivation and goal setting to focus and decision making that explain why some people and companies get so much done. Drawing on the latest findings in neuroscience, psychology, and behavioral economics as well as the experiences of CEOs, educational reformers, four-star generals, FBI agents, airplane pilots, and Broadway songwriters this painstakingly researched book explains that the most productive people, companies, and organizations don t merely act differently. They view the world, and their choices, in profoundly different ways. In""The Power of Habit, "" Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Charles Duhigg explained why we do what we do. In ""Smarter Faster Better, ""he applies the same relentless curiosity, deep reporting, and rich storytelling to explain how we can improve at the things we do. It s a groundbreaking exploration of the science of productivity, one that can help anyone learn to succeed with less stress and struggle, and to get more done without sacrificing what we care about most to become smarter, faster, and better at everything we do. Advance praise for ""Smarter Faster Better"" As he did in ""The Power of Habit, ""Duhigg melds cutting-edge science, deep reporting, and wide-ranging stories to give us a fuller, more human way of thinking about how productivity actually happens. Susan Cain, author of ""Quiet"" Duhigg uses engaging storytelling to highlight fascinating research and core principles that we can all learn and use in our daily lives. A masterful must-read for anyone who wants to get more (and more creative) stuff done. David Allen, author of ""Getting Things Done"" Duhigg has a gift for asking just the right question, and then igniting the same curiosity in the rest of us. In ""Smarter Faster Better"" he finds provocative answers to a riddle of our age.

Cambridge University,(Edited) Rita Barnard,"Nelson Mandela was one of the most revered figures of our time. He committed himself to a compelling political cause, suffered a long prison sentence and led his violent and divided country to a peaceful democratic transition. His legacy however is not uncontested: his decision to embark on an armed struggle in the 1960s, his solitary talks with apartheid officials in the 1980s and the economic policies adopted during his presidency still spark intense debate, even after his death. The essays in this Companion, written by experts in history, anthropology, jurisprudence, cinema, literature and visual studies, address these and other issues. They examine how Mandela became an icon during his lifetime and consider the meanings and uses of his internationally recognizable image. Their overarching concerns include Mandela's relation to 'tradition' and 'modernity', the impact of his most famous public performances, the oscillation between Africanist and non - racial positions in South Africa and the politics of gender and national sentiment. The volume concludes with a meditation on Mandela's legacy in the twenty-first century and a detailed guide to further reading.",2014-04-13,1107440009,9781107440005,BOOKS,The Cambridge Companion to Nelson Mandela,"Rs. 1,600.00",Paperback,349,-

Harper Collins India,Janhavi Acharekar,"These charming portraits of young girls living far from home, 'secure' in their illicit relationships, of young men full of RSS swagger, of old women waiting late in the night for their grown-up children to come home, capture the lives of ordinary people in vivid and varied hues. Spread across the socio-economic spectrum, these stories are like snapshots of interesting faces in a crowd: faces around whom the author deftly sketches lives and longings, pet ideas and prejudices, loves and hates with bold, confident strokes. From 'Ganesha', the story of a middle-class housewife waiting for her son to return at night and thinking of her other son who died in a road accident, to 'A Game of Cards' about a young urban woman sunning herself on the beach, these pithy sketches are a colourful montage of modern Indian life.",2009, 8172238002,9788172238001,BOOKS,Window Seat,"Rs. 1,475.00",Paperback,256,-

Scribner Book Company,David Quammen,"A two-time winner of the ""National Magazine"" Award takes readers from the central Amazon to the streets of New York to explore scientific facts, ideas, and wonders. In ""Wild Thoughts from Wild Places,"" award-winning journalist David Quammen reminds us why he has become one of our most beloved science and nature writers. This collection of twenty-three of Quammen's most intriguing, most exciting, most memorable pieces takes us to meet kayakers on the Futaleufu River of southern Chile, where Quammen describes how it feels to travel in fast company and flail for survival in the river's maw. We are introduced to the commerce in pearls (and black-market parrots) in the Aru Islands of eastern Indonesia. Quammen even finds wildness in smog-choked Los Angeles -- embodied in an elusive population of urban coyotes, too stubborn and too clever to surrender to the sprawl of civilization. With humor and intelligence, David Quammen's ""Wild Thoughts from Wild Places"" also reminds us that humans are just one of the many species on earth with motivations, goals, quirks, and eccentricities. Expect to be entertained and moved on this journey through the wilds of science and nature.",Mar 1999,068485208X,9780684852089,BOOKS,Wild Thoughts from Wild Places,"Rs. 3,125.00",Paperback,304,8.36 x 5.56 x 0.81 inches

"Little, Brown Book Group",J. K. Rowling,"When Barry Fairweather dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock. Pagford is, seemingly, an English idyll, with a cobbled market square and an ancient abbey, but what lies behind the pretty façade is a town at war. Rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils…Pagford is not what it first seems. And the empty seat left by Barry on the parish council soon becomes the catalyst for the biggest war the town has yet seen. Who will triumph in an election fraught with passion, duplicity and unexpected revelations? Blackly comic, thought-provoking and constantly surprising, The Casual Vacancy is J.K.

W. W. Norton & Company,Nicholas Carr,"The best-selling author of The Big Switch returns with an explosive look at technology’s effect on the mind. “Is Google making us stupid?” When Nicholas Carr posed that question, in a celebrated Atlantic Monthly cover story, he tapped into a well of anxiety about how the Internet is changing us. He also crystallized one of the most important debates of our time: As we enjoy the Net’s bounties, are we sacrificing our ability to read and think deeply? Now, Carr expands his argument into the most compelling exploration of the Internet’s intellectual and cultural consequences yet published. As he describes how human thought has been shaped through the centuries by “tools of the mind”—from the alphabet to maps, to the printing press, the clock, and the computer—Carr interweaves a fascinating account of recent discoveries in neuroscience by such pioneers as Michael Merzenich and Eric Kandel. Our brains, the historical and scientific evidence reveals, change in response to our experiences. The technologies we use to find, store, and share information can literally reroute our neural pathways. Building on the insights of thinkers from Plato to McLuhan, Carr makes a convincing case that every information technology carries an intellectual ethic—a set of assumptions about the nature of knowledge and intelligence. He explains how the printed book served to focus our attention, promoting deep and creative thought. In stark contrast, the Internet encourages the rapid, distracted sampling of small bits of information from many sources. Its ethic is that of the industrialist, an ethic of speed and efficiency, of optimized production and consumption—and now the Net is remaking us in its own image. We are becoming ever more adept at scanning and skimming, but what we are losing is our capacity for concentration, contemplation, and reflection. Part intellectual history, part popular science, and part cultural criticism, The Shallows sparkles with memorable vignettes—Friedrich Nietzsche wrestling with a typewriter, Sigmund Freud dissecting the brains of sea creatures, Nathaniel Hawthorne contemplating the thunderous approach of a steam locomotive—even as it plumbs profound questions about the state of our modern psyche. This is a book that will forever alter the way we think about media and our minds",2010-06-15,0393072223,978-0393072228,SECOND-HAND BOOKS,The Shallows,"Rs. 1,850.00",hardcover,288,-

-," Jean-Jacques Lambin, Isabelle Schuiling","Market-Driven Management adopts a broad approach to marketing, integrating the strategic and operational elements of the discipline. Lambin's unique approach reflects how marketing operates empirically, as both a business philosophy and an action-oriented process. Motivated by the increased complexity of markets, globalisation, deregulation, and the development of e-commerce, the author challenges the traditional concept of the 4Ps and the functional roles of marketing departments, focusing instead on the concept of market orientation. The book considers all of the key market stakeholders, arguing that developing market relations and enhancing customer value is the responsibility of every member of the organization, and that the development of this customer value is the only way for a firm to achieve profit and growth. New to this edition: - Greater coverage of ethical issues and corporate social responsibility: cultural diversity: value and branding and the economic downturn - Broad international perspective - Thoroughly revised to reflect the latest academic thinking and research With its unique approach, international cases and complementary online resources, this book is ideal for postgraduate and upper level undergraduate students of marketing, and for MBAs and Executive MBAs.",-,0230276024,9780230276024,DISCOUNTED BOOKS,Market-Driven Management 3rd Edition,"Rs. 5,000.00",Paperback,-,-

Free Press,Seth Godin,"The book that does for companies what WHO MOVED MY CHEESE? does for individual employees, SURVIVAL IS NOT ENOUGH provides a groundbreaking new way to organise companies and thrive during times of change. Everything in our world, from marketing to technology to distribution to the capital markets, is moving at a faster pace than ever. Yet most companies view change as a threat, and survival as the goal. This book transforms all that. It contains a simple yet revolutionary idea: we can evolve our companies the same way nature evolves a species. Evolution is a fundamental force of nature, and Seth Godin demonstrates how it can be put to work in any organisation. The first step is to eliminate the anti-change reflex that's genetically coded into all of us. Once a company learns to 'zoom' (to change without panicking), it is much more likely to evolve. And a company that evolves can become ever more profitable. For the last five years, bestselling author Seth Godin has repeatedly demonstrated the power of his books by living their advice. He used the tactics in PERMISSION MARKETING to drive the book up the bestseller list. He followed the advice of UNLEASHING THE IDEA VIRUS to turn his treatise into a living example of an ideavirus. Now, as a committed zoomer, he shows his legions of fans how to turn their company into one that can zoom from one change to another. It's a formula for success whether the market is up or down, whether technology is hot or not, in all industries, from retail to tech to restaurants.",2003-03-03,0743221230,978-0743221238,SECOND-HAND BOOKS,Survival is Not Enough,Rs. 750.00,papercover,288,-

HYPERION,RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI,"Writing in his familiar voice -- a New Yorker's bluntness, leavened by his passion for ideas -- Rudolph Giuliani demonstrates in Leadership how the leadership skills he practices can be employed successfully by anyone who has to run anything. After all, until the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center pushed him into an unwanted role in history, Giuliani was only months away from leaving office with a reputation as one of the most effective mayors New York had ever seen. Having inherited a city ravaged by crime and crippled in its ability to serve its citizens, Giuliani shows how he found that every aspect of his career up to that point-from clerking for the formidable judge who demanded excellence (and rewarded it with a lifetime of loyalty) to busting organized crime during his years as a federal attorney-shaped his thinking about leadership and prepared him for the daunting challenges ahead. Giuliani's successes in turn strengthened his conviction about the core qualities required to be an effective leader, no matter what the size of the organization, be it an international corporation or a baseball team. In detailing his principles of leadership, Giuliani tells captivating stories that are personal as well as prescriptive: how he learned the importance of staying calm in the face of attack from his father's boxing lessons-as well as the need to stand up to bullies: how a love of reading was early instilled in him by his mother and grew into a determination to master new subjects, and not rely on only the word of experts: how, in his recent fight with prostate cancer, learning to make decisions at the right time and with the right information reflected decision-making on a larger scale. Leadership, Giuliani writes, works both ways: it is a privilege, but it carries responsibilities-from imposing a structure suitable to an organization's purpose, to forming a team of people who bring out the best in each other, to taking the right, unexpected risks.",-,1401351875,978-1401351878,SECOND-HAND BOOKS,Leadership,Rs. 700.00,paperback,-,-

Levine draws on his broad experience as a clinician, a student of comparative brain research, a stress scientist and a keen observer of the naturalistic animal world to explain the nature and transformation of trauma in the body, brain and psyche. In an Unspoken Voice is based on the idea that trauma is neither a disease nor a disorder, but rather an injury caused by fright, helplessness and loss that can be healed by engaging our innate capacity to self-regulate high states of arousal and intense emotions.

Penguin,Rommel Rodrigues,"On 26 November 2008 ten heavily armed terrorists entered Mumbai. They headed for the city’s iconic landmarks and the mayhem they unleashed lasted nearly 60 hours. The audacious terror attacks jolted Mumbai like never before. Even as they mourned, the residents of Maximum City demanded answers. But the information they got in return—accounts of the investigation, government rhetoric, newspaper reports, television features, books and even a film—was sketchy at best. Meanwhile, the courts continued with their prosecution of Mohammed Ajmal Amir Kasab, the lone surviving 26/11 gunman. The broad picture available to the public is of the Pakistan-based terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Taiba and its ringleaders such as Hafiz Muhammad Saeed and Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi training, arming and dispatching ten young men in a boat to attack India’s commercial capital. All we have been told about Kasab is that he was just another recruit brainwashed into carrying out the plot against Mumbai. Kasab: The Face of 26/11 breaks new ground by painstakingly piecing together Kasab’s terror trail. The narrative follows Kasab through the bylanes of Pakistani villages and cities as he made his way towards PoK: the dense forests where the terrorist-training camps are situated: the trains, buses and jeeps he boarded: the Indian vessel he and the others hijacked en route to Mumbai’s shores: Kasab’s capture and incarceration. Rommel Rodrigues’ path-breaking investigative journalism fleshes out for the first time the well thought-out planning and organization that lay behind the attacks of 26/11.",2010-12-10,0143415476,9780143415473,SECOND-HAND BOOKS,Kasab,Rs. 400.00,Paperback,-,-

Her fast track job on Wall Street had veered to a stop, and she had nothing to grab on except for a payless opportunity to work at a legal aid clinic. At the end of a year, there was a small chance she’d get her old job back, a really small chance. From the grand metropolis of Manhattan, her new job takes her to Brady, Virginia, set in the heart of a place she’d only read about: the Appalachia. Here, she works under Mattie Wyatt, who has lived here his entire life and heads the legal aid clinic. He teaches her about helping people with real problems. Samantha’s new job teaches her how to prepare an actual lawsuit, face a real courtroom, take a judge’s scoldings head on and receive threats from townsfolk who are displeased about having an urban lawyer in their town. Her work is pretty much cut out for her, but there’s one problem: Brady has a secret.

Wiley India Pvt. Ltd.,Nitin Pangarkar,"High Performance Companies complements the approach adopted by many of the existing books on strategy. The author proposes a number of thumb rules (or principles) that companies can consider while making their day-to-day decisions which, in turn, will determine their actual strategy. These principles traverse a wide spectrum of scenarios, such as strategic changes implemented by companies, resource allocation decisions especially towards building durable assets, and resource acquisition through inorganic means. The book adopts a reader-friendly approach by teasing out the lessons from detailed cases studies of interesting companies. The writing minimizes jargon while maintaining rigor especially with regard to the applicability and relevance of the strategic principles to different business contexts. Nitin also cites extensive evidence in support of the proposed arguments (e.g., about performance achieved, resources deployed) and achieves this without making the material intimidating (in other words, without sacrificing readability) for a typical business student or manager. The combination of both short and long case studies in each chapter demonstrate the general applicability of the principles and also improve the relevance to a typical reader by introducing diversity in contexts.

Bantam Press,"Tyler Hamilton, Daniel Coyle","The Secret Race is a definitive look at the world of professional cycling—and the doping issue surrounding this sport and its most iconic rider, Lance Armstrong—by former Olympic gold medalist Tyler Hamilton and New York Times bestselling author Daniel Coyle. Over the course of two years, Coyle conducted more than two hundred hours of interviews with Hamilton and spoke candidly with numerous teammates, rivals, and friends. The result is an explosive book that takes us, for the first time, deep inside a shadowy, fascinating, and surreal world of unscrupulous doctors, anything-goes team directors, and athletes so relentlessly driven to succeed that they would do anything—and take any risk, physical, mental, or moral—to gain the edge they need to win. Tyler Hamilton was once one of the world’s best-liked and top-ranked cyclists—a fierce competitor renowned among his peers for his uncanny endurance and epic tolerance for pain. In the 2003 Tour de France, he finished fourth despite breaking his collarbone in the early stages—and grinding eleven of his teeth down to the nerves along the way. He started his career with the U.S. Postal Service team in the 1990s and quickly rose to become Lance Armstrong’s most trusted lieutenant, and a member of his inner circle. For the first three of Armstrong’s record seven Tour de France victories, Hamilton was by Armstrong’s side, clearing his way. But just weeks after Hamilton reached his own personal pinnacle—winning the gold medal at the 2004 Olympics—his career came to a sudden, ignominious end: He was found guilty of doping and exiled from the sport. From the exhilaration of his early, naïve days in the peloton, Hamilton chronicles his ascent to the uppermost reaches of this unforgiving sport. In the mid-1990s, the advent of a powerful new blood-boosting drug called EPO reshaped the world of cycling, and a relentless, win-at-any-cost ethos took root. Its psychological toll would drive many of the sport’s top performers to substance abuse, depression, even suicide. For the first time ever, Hamilton recounts his own battle with clinical depression, speaks frankly about the agonizing choices that go along with the decision to compete at a world-class level, and tells the story of his complicated relationship with Lance Armstrong. A journey into the heart of a never-before-seen world, The Secret Race is a riveting, courageous act of witness from a man who is as determined to reveal the hard truth about his sport as he once was to win the Tour de France.",2012-09-11,0593071743,9780593071748,BOOKS," The Secret Race: Inside the Hidden World of the Tour de France: Doping, Cover-Ups, and Winning at All Costs","Rs. 3,500.00",Paperback,352,-

Rockport Publishers Inc,Wilson Harvey/Loewy,"This book contains a collection of 1,000 instances of thoughtful type usage along with credits that note what fonts were used in the design. Like its predecessor, ""1,000 Graphic Elements"", the photography in this book focuses in on the typography so readers can get an up-close look at the work. ""1,000 Type Treatments"" showcases an array of fonts in a catalogue-like format, making it easy for the working designer to practically shop for ideas. The book is organised by style so if a designer has a traditional, elegant, or edgy piece, they can go directly to that section of the book, where they will find a wide collection of fresh ideas in the style they are seeking. Also included is a directory of font foundries and suppliers, providing busy designers with a quick reference guide to where they can find the fonts that pique their interest.",2008-09-24,1592534821,9781592534821,DISCOUNTED BOOKS,"1000 Type Treatments: From Script to Serif, Letterforms","Rs. 2,900.00",Paperback,440,-
